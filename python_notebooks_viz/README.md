# TSP Analysis and Visualization

This part of the project focuses on analyzing the results obtained from solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances using our application. The analysis includes importing log files and graph TSPs to generate insights and visualizations.


## Environment Setup

To facilitate the analysis and visualization process, I've added a `environment.yml` file to create a Conda environment with all the necessary dependencies.

To set up the environment:

1. Make sure you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following commands:

   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate tsp-analysis
   jupyter lab
   ```
